> New website for the Tech Access team ran by the Kansas City Public Library

Website is built using NUXT.js to SSR the Vue.js app. Vuetify.js is used for component styling and Cockpit CMS is used for the back end. CMS is running in a docker container and uses a sub domain for the api to hit. i.e. google.com front end, cms.google.com backend
